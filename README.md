## TEXT CALCULATOR

Do you speak another language?
[Spanish](README_ES.md)* Everything you need to know in Spanish.

## Description
This code runs a small program that allows the user to choose from four options. The user must enter a word or phrase which, depending on the previously selected choice, will be processed.

## How does it work?
The program first asks if you wish to proceed. After choosing YES, you can select from four options:

1. **Vowel Counter**: Iterates through each vowel in a predefined vowel dictionary while also scanning the input word. When it finds a match for one or more vowels, it adds to the count for that specific vowel and the total number of vowels in the word.

2. **Consonant Counter**: Iterates through each consonant in a predefined consonant dictionary while also scanning the input word. When it finds a match for one or more consonants, it adds to the count for that specific consonant and the total number of consonants in the word.

3. **Vowel and Consonant Counter**: Iterates through each alphabetical character and counts each time one appears.

4. **Palindrome Check**: Verifies if the word reads the same backwards as it was entered by the user. Ideally, a single word should be entered for correct execution. Otherwise, the program will state that the phrase is not a palindrome.

## Requirements
- Python
- Text Editor or IDE
*NO ADDITIONAL INSTALLATIONS OF OTHER PYTHON LIBRARIES ARE REQUIRED TO RUN THE PROGRAM*

## Upcoming Updates
The main purpose is to create an understandable and replicable program for learning.
Other versions of the program will be created soon with greater efficiency and more options.
